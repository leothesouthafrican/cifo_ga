This project is about artificial intelligence implementation in the cult game - "Snake".
Our goal is to teach a neural network to play the game and achieve good performances using genetic algorithms to optimize the weights of the network.

This project was carried out as part of the Computational Intelligence for Optimisation Masters Course at Nova IMS
