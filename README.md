This project is about artificial intelligence implementation in the cult game - "Snake".
Our goal is to teach a neural network to play the game and achieve good performances using genetic algorithms to optimize the weights of the network.

In order to run the program and generate the results as an excel file, run python snake_main.py after haing updated the game parameters in the same file.

This project was carried out as part of the Computational Intelligence for Optimisation Masters Course at Nova IMS.
